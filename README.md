There's, like, stuff that happens during the day that is useful to have
tracked. I've been meaning to write this for a while, but now that I have a
baby, I have buckets of things I need to track - diaper changes, feedings, poop
status, etc. Exciting!

## Goals

A few taps and boom track an event. Graph events over time. Show recent events.
Search, maybe. Events have attributes other than "this happened at this time"

Make it easy to create new event types from the UI.

## Features

* local storage for simple offline stuff (when AT&T or wifi is being dumb)
* remote storage for syncing data between devices
* authentication for multiuser?

## Examples

Stuff like... "I took ibuprofen at 3pm." is an event. "How many" would be an
attribute. For baby feedings, how was she fed? (bottle/syringe/breast/etc)


## Fun ideas

* make 'backup' under local storage generate a bookmarklet for restoring
